# This Repo Covers Python from Basic to Advanced Level

# Python
- Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
- Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

# Features of Python
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.
- It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.

# What is Python used for?
- Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
- Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
- It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
- It is used to create web applications.
- It can be used to handle databases.
- It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.

# Modules in Python
Module is like a code library having the required packages related to that module by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:
- Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. There is no need to install such modules explicitly.
- External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.

# pip command
It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module.
- pip/pip3 install <module_name>

Eg: pip install pandas or <b>pip3 install sklearn</b>

# import syntax
Import syntax is used to import a module in Python
-  import <module_name>

Eg: import pandas
