Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.

A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. 
Properties are the data or state of an object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.

An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods.

Key features of OOP in Python:
1. Encapsulation, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's
methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.

2. Inheritance, which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. 
This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.

3. Polymorphism, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. 
This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.
